## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT — demonstrating how to build an intelligent **AI Study Assistant** that organizes learning schedules, generates revision plans, offers explanations, and enhances academic productivity through structured prompts.

---

## Objectives
1. To learn the fundamentals of prompt engineering for educational tools.  
2. To build a Study Assistant that manages subjects, revision plans, and clarification of doubts.  
3. To simulate natural-language interactions with an AI tutor.  
4. To explore how detailed prompts improve accuracy and quality of outputs.  
5. To encourage creative use of LLMs for personalized learning workflows.

## Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are capable of functioning as tutors, planners, and intelligent assistants. When combined with clear prompts, they help generate explanations, quizzes, study schedules, and revision strategies — all without writing complex code.

A prompt-based Study Assistant allows learners to improve study habits, prepare for exams, and revise effectively using natural conversation.  
This experiment demonstrates how simple prompts evolve into an adaptive, efficient learning companion.

---

## AI Tools Required
- ChatGPT (GPT-5 or equivalent)  
- Python / Flask (optional interface)  
- Command-line or Chat interface  
- Google Sheets / Notion (optional tracking)

---

## Explanation
Prompt-based systems depend on the clarity and detail of user queries.  
- **Basic prompts** give straightforward answers.  
- **Intermediate prompts** generate structured plans.  
- **Advanced prompts** lead to adaptive, intelligent behavior such as identifying weak topics or creating custom quizzes.

By progressively improving prompts, we can build an AI Study Assistant with features such as:
- Smart study planning  
- Automated quiz generation  
- Concept explanations at multiple difficulty levels  
- Adaptive learning based on performance

# Prompt Design and Outputs

---

## Prompt 1 – Basic Prompt

**Prompt:**  
“Explain Newton’s First Law in two lines.”

**Output:**  
Newton’s First Law states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.  
It describes the principle of inertia.

---

## Prompt 2 – Intermediate Prompt

**Prompt:**  
“Create a revision plan for tomorrow with 3 subjects and 1-hour slots each.”

**Output:**  
**Revision Plan:**  
- 9 AM – 10 AM: Mathematics (Derivatives)  
- 10 AM – 11 AM: DBMS (ER Model)  
- 11 AM – 12 PM: Python (Functions & Modules)

---

## Prompt 3 – Advanced Prompt

**Prompt:**  
“Design an AI Study Assistant that creates study schedules, generates MCQs, gives explanations, and adapts to my weak areas.”

**Output:**  

### AI Study Assistant Features

#### 1. Smart Study Planner  
- Generates daily or weekly study timetables  
- Splits topics into smaller modules  
- Example: “You have free time from 5–7 PM. Shall I schedule revision?”

#### 2. Doubt Solver  
- Explains any concept in simple, moderate, or advanced levels  
- Example: “Explain machine learning like I’m a beginner.”

#### 3. MCQ Generator  
- Creates quizzes with answers  
- Example: “Generate 5 MCQs on Operating Systems (Deadlocks).”

#### 4. Adaptive Learning  
- Detects weak subjects and prioritizes revision  
- Example: “You struggled with DBMS queries — revise them today?”

### Sample Simulation  
**User:** “Generate 3 MCQs for Networking.”  
**Assistant:** Provides 3 MCQs with answers.

**User:** “Plan my evening study session.”  
**Assistant:**  
- 6 PM – OS Revision  
- 7 PM – Python Practice  
- 8 PM – Networking Quiz  

---

# Procedure
1. Identify learning needs such as subjects, weak topics, and exam schedules.  
2. Design prompts from basic explanations to advanced interactive features.  
3. Test prompts using ChatGPT or an LLM interface.  
4. Refine prompts based on clarity, structure, and relevance.  
5. Observe adaptability and consistency of the AI’s responses.

---

# Observation
- Basic prompts yield short, simple outputs.  
- Intermediate prompts produce structured plans.  
- Advanced prompts create a complete learning assistant with adaptive feedback.  
The quality and usefulness of responses increased with more detailed and contextual prompts.
